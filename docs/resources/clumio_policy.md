# clumio_policy (Resource)

Clumio Policy Resource used to schedule backups on Clumio supported data sources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "clumio_policy" "example" {
  name                   = "example-policy"
  organizational_unit_id = "organizational_unit_id"
  activation_status      = "activated"
  operations {
    action_setting = "window"
    type           = "protection_group_backup"
    slas {
      retention_duration {
        unit  = "months"
        value = 3
      }
      rpo_frequency {
        unit  = "days"
        value = 1
      }
    }
    advanced_settings {
      protection_group_backup {
        backup_tier = "cold"
      }
    }
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The unique name of the policy.
- `operations` (Block Set, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations))

### Optional

- `activation_status` (String) The status of the policy. Valid values are:activated: Backups will take place regularly according to the policy SLA.deactivated: Backups will not begin until the policy is reactivated. The assets associated with the policy will have their compliance status set to deactivated.
- `organizational_unit_id` (String) The Clumio-assigned ID of the organizational unit associated with the policy.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Policy Id.
- `lock_status` (String) Policy Lock Status.

### Nested Schema for `operations`

Required:

- `action_setting` (String) Determines whether the policy should take action now or during the specified backup window. Valid values:immediate: to start backup process immediatelywindow: to start backup in the specified window
- `slas` (Block Set, Min: 1) The service level agreement (SLA) for the policy. A policy can include one or more SLAs. For example, a policy can retain daily backups for a month each, and monthly backups for a year each. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations--slas))
- `type` (String) The operation to be performed for this SLA set.Each SLA set corresponds to one and only one operation. Depending on the operation selected, advanced settings may need to be set.

Optional:

- `advanced_settings` (Block Set, Max: 1) Additional operation-specific policy settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations--advanced_settings))
- `backup_window` (Block Set, Max: 1) The start and end times for the customized backup window. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations--backup_window))

### Nested Schema for `operations.slas`

Required:

- `rpo_frequency` (Block Set, Min: 1, Max: 1) The minimum frequency between backups for this SLA. Also known as the recovery point objective (RPO) interval. For example, to configure the minimum frequency between backups to be every 2 days, set unit=days and value=2. To configure the SLA for on-demand backups, set unit=on_demand and leave the value field empty. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations--slas--rpo_frequency))

### Nested Schema for `operations.slas.rpo_frequency`

Required:

- `unit` (String) The measurement unit of the SLA parameter. Values include hours, days, months, and years.
- `value` (Number) The measurement value of the SLA parameter.

(see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations--advanced_settings--mssql_database_backup))
- `mssql_log_backup` (Block Set, Max: 1) Additional policy configuration settings for the mssql_log_backup operation. If this operation is not of type mssql_log_backup, then this field is omitted from the response. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations--advanced_settings--mssql_log_backup))
