## Schema

### Optional

- `auto_logout_duration` (Number) The length of time before a user is logged out of the Clumio system due to inactivity. Measured in seconds. The valid range is between 600 seconds (10 minutes) and 3600 seconds (60 minutes). If not configured, the value defaults to 900 seconds (15 minutes).
- `ip_allowlist` (Set of String) The designated range of IP addresses that are allowed to access the Clumio REST API. API requests that originate from outside this list will be blocked. The IP address of the server from which this request is being made must be in this list; otherwise, the request will fail. Set the parameter to individual IP addresses and/or a range of IP addresses in CIDR notation. For example, [`193.168.1.0/24`, `193.172.1.1`]. If not configured, the value defaults to [`0.0.0.0/0`] meaning all addresses will be allowed.
- `password_expiration_duration` (Number) The length of time a user password is valid before it must be changed. Measured in seconds. The valid range is between 2592000 seconds (30 days) and 15552000 seconds (180 days). If not configured, the value defaults to 7776000 seconds (90 days).
