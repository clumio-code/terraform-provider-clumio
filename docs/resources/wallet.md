## Schema

### Required

- `account_native_id` (String) Identifier of the AWS account to be setup with BYOK and associated with the wallet.

### Read-Only

- `clumio_account_id` (String) Identifier of the AWS account associated with Clumio. This identifier is provided so that access to the service role for Clumio can be restricted to just this account.
